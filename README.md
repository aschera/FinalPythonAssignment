The final assignment for my Python course in the Data Science education.<br /> 

I'm going to use the following libraries to create my API:<br />
- Django framework <br />

I created a web app which serves a REST API.<br />
It is connected to a sqLite database.<br />

#-------------------------------------#

There are two documents to seed the database - seed the breweries first, then the beers for it to work.<br />
The seed data is found in this project under BeerAPI\CraftBeerInfoApp\seed_data.<br />

#-------------------------------------#

There are two GET endpoints.<br />
There are two POST endpoints.<br />
There is one PUT endpoint.<br />
There is one DELETE endpoint.<br /><br />

<br />

#-------------------------------------#

## How to start:

 cd .\BeerAPI\   
 <br />
 python manage.py runserver       
 <br />

 open: <br />
 http://127.0.0.1:8000/<br />
