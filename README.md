The final assignment for my Python course in the Data Science education. 

I'm going to use the following libraries to create my API:
- Django framework

I created a web app which serves a REST API.
It is connected to a sqLite database.

#-------------------------------------#

There are two documents to seed the database - seed the breweries first, then the beers for it to work.
The seed data is found in this project under BeerAPI\CraftBeerInfoApp\seed_data.

#-------------------------------------#

There are two GET endpoints.
There are two POST endpoints.
There is one PUT endpoint.
There is one DELETE endpoint.

#-------------------------------------#

## How to start:

 cd .\BeerAPI\
 python manage.py runserver     

 open: 
 http://127.0.0.1:8000/
